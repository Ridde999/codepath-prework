    Connectify
    I want to build a social connection app that doesn't use the internet. I feel like a lot of underdeveloped nations are not able to use most social media because its reliance on the internet. I would want to make a similar type of application to Instagram. It would have posts and to add someone you would have to share and experience that you had with them. Therefore, you could only add people you are actually close with, and you can't add random people you met just once. It would have most of the same connection features as Instagram. However, it wouldn't have reels and the homepage would only be for your friends. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
